`git` is used by major tech companies and lone individuals alike to manage their code. <a href="https://git-scm.com/videos">These videos</a> are helpful for some more basic information about version control and `git`. There's also a 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">free e-book</a> that walks through all of the main `git` operations.

# File Setup
## Python Virtual Environment
- Launch `Powershell` or `cmd`. It should start in your Windows user folder: `C:\Users\...`
- Create a folder to store virtual environments<br>
`mkdir Envs`
- Create a virtual environment (`venv`) for your project. `first_venv` can be replaced with any other name<br>
`python -m venv .\Envs\first_venv`
- Activate the virtual environment<br>
`& .\Envs\first_venv\Scripts\activate`

## Folder Setup
- Navigate to the folder that you plan to store your files in, usually in somewhere in `C:\Users\Documents\...`<br>
    - You can change folders with the `cd` command
    - `.\` indicates the current folder
    - You can use auto completion on the paths using the `TAB` key<br>
`cd .\D` can be auto-completed to `cd .\Documents\`
- Clone the `git` repository into the folder.<br>
`git clone https://github.com/jsl12/office_training`

## Install Packages
Install all the packages using a single command: `pip install .\office_training\requirements.txt`. `pip` installs packages (pre-written Python code) by downloading them from <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>, the Python Package Index
